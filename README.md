# R Course - Fall 2024 Edition
Luiz Felipe Almeida and Francisco Palmero welcome Ciampitti Lab members to the R Course Fall 2024 edition.

# A Little of History about This Course
This course was created in 2021 by $\textbf{Josefina Lacasa}$ as a setting to learn basic concepts of R programming and applied statistics. The idea behind this course was to provide Ciampitti Lab members with elemental skills in programming and applied statistics to help them succeed in industry or grad schools.

Josefina dictated the course in Fall 2021 and 2022 editions. Francisco took care of it in the Fall 2023. In the Fall 2024 Luiz and Francisco will co-lead the course, dictate some classes, and help on solving potential pitfalls.

# Fall 2024 Edition: Objective
In the Fall 2024 edition, the original objective remains untouched. In this 3-month course, the goal is to provide trainees with the basic concepts of R programming and applied statistics.

$\textbf{Motivations:}$
What motivated the origin of this course was the idea of speeding up the R-learning process and having the basic elements to perform applied statistical analyses and create publishable plots to communicate results.
There are several software to conduct statistical analyses and produce figures to communicate them. So, why did we choose R?  R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics with a big community using it. Therefore, R has two main advantages: i) it is $\textbf{free}$ and ii) it has a tremendous amount of documentation supporting the information needed to perform different tasks.  

$\textbf{Expectations:}$
At the end of this course, we expect that people taking the course can apply the basics of data analysis workflow to their own data, projects, work, etc.
